kMeansClustering
===

Clustering is a way of learning about similarities in a dataset.
It's different from classifying because clasiffiers belong
to supervised category of ML algorythms. This means
that while learning we know to which class each feature belongs.

Clustering as a unsupervised algorythm doesn't know about the classes
of features, it only tries to find similarities between them.
